About the Projects
Public Health Dashboard
This mini-project involves creating a Public Health Dashboard using Excel and Python. It uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4 and NFHS-5) to analyze and visualize public health indicators like literacy rates, clean fuel use, and health insurance coverage. The project highlights progress and identifies gaps by comparing data from 2015-16 with 2019-21.

Fake News Detection Dashboard
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing fake news using Python-based NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and Power BI for visualization. It classifies news as real or fake and visualizes trends over time, providing a tool to monitor the spread of misinformation.

Sales Performance Dashboard
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales activities using Excel, Python, and Power BI. It tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue and profit margin and uses trend analysis to identify growth opportunities and inform strategic planning.
