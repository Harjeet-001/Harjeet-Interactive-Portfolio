        <div class="about-content">
            <p>My mini project focuses on developing a Public Health Dashboard using Excel and Python, based on data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4 and NFHS-5). The aim is to analyze and visualize key indicators such as literacy rates, clean fuel adoption, birth registration, and health insurance coverage across Indian states. By comparing NFHS-4 (2015â€“16) with NFHS-5 (2019â€“21), the project highlights progress made in public health and education while also identifying gaps, such as the gender literacy divide and urban-rural disparities. The use of Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn ensures efficient data cleaning and visualization, while Excel serves as a medium for structured reporting. Overall, the dashboard provides actionable insights into Indiaâ€™s health and social development trends, making it valuable for academic, research, and policy purposes.</p>

                <h3>Fake News Detection Dashboard  - Sentiment Analysis and Power BI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Fake News Intelligence Dashboard is designed to detect and analyze misleading or false information circulating online by combining sentiment analysis with interactive Power BI visualization. Using Python-based NLP techniques, the project processes news headlines and articles to identify patterns, classify them as real or fake, and extract the underlying sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).</li>
                    <li>The processed insights are then integrated into Power BI dashboards, where users can interactively explore trends in fake news across time, sources, and categories. This project not only demonstrates how data analytics can be applied to tackle misinformation but also provides a real-time, user-friendly interface for decision-makers, researchers, and the public to understand and monitor the spread of fake news.</li>

                <h3>Sales Performance Dashboard - KPI's and Trend Analysis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Sales Performance Dashboard is developed to provide a comprehensive view of business sales activities through key performance indicators (KPIs) and trend analysis. Using tools like Excel, Python, and Power BI, the project consolidates sales data to track metrics such as total revenue, profit margin, regional sales distribution, top-performing products, and customer segments.</li>
                    <li>Trend analysis is applied to identify seasonal patterns, growth opportunities, and areas of decline, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions. The dashboard enables managers to monitor performance in real time, compare targets vs. actual sales, and uncover actionable insights that improve strategic planning and overall business efficiency.</li>

                <h3>Public Health Dashboard</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Public Health Dashboard leverages Excel and Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study and visualize health and demographic indicators from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4 & NFHS-5). The project focuses on analyzing key factors such as literacy rates, clean fuel adoption, sanitation, health insurance coverage, and gender disparities across different Indian states.</li>
                    <li>Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, while Excel supports structured reporting and dashboard creation. By comparing NFHS-4 and NFHS-5, the project highlights improvements, regional gaps, and emerging challenges in Indiaâ€™s public health landscape, offering insights that can aid policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders.</li>
